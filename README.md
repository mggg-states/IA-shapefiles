# Iowa Election Shapefile
This shapefile was obtained from the US Census Bureau and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG). It is at the county level, as Iowa has strict laws regarding county preservation in congressional redistricting.

## Sources
The county shapefile comes from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from [American FactFinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). County level election data for presidential elections since 2000 were obtained from the [MIT Elections Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu). The Congressional district shapefile was obtained from the [Iowa Legislature](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/districtMaps).

## Processing
Election data from the MIT Elections Data and Science Lab was cleaned by MGGG staff in order to join it to the county shapefile. Demographic data   were joined to the county shapefile in QGIS.
